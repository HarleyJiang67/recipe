Shrimp: Use large shrimp if possible, either raw or pre-cooked. I share the steaming method below if you bought it raw. You can leave the shrimp whole or chop it up into thirds to make them more bite-sized pieces.
Avocado: Make sure they are ripe but firm for best consistency with the salad. Add them right before serving.
Red onions: They give great flavor to the shrimp avocado salad without overpowering it.
Dressing: The homemade dressing is made with extra virgin olive oil and fresh squeezed lime juice, along with some cumin, salt and pepper. If you donâ€™t like the taste of cumin, you can definitely skip that. The dressing really brings the salad together wonderfully!
